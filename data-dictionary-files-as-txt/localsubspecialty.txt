This local sub specialty code is a separate field, rather than an extension.
For RTT PTL data set: This refers to the local sub specialty for the current stage of the patient’s pathway at the time of reporting. If unknown, the local sub specialty on referral should be used.
 
For Referral to Treatment Times (Combined):-
-      Local Sub Specialty must always be submitted, noting that ‘000’ means no appropriate Local Sub Specialty;
-      Codes for “Assessment” activity (i.e. 666, 166, 266, 366, and 966) are not permissible in the RTT (Combined) return.
