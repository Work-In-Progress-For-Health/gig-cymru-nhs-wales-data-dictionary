This is the date, time and time zone when the patient PHYSICALLY LEAVES an Urgent and Emergency Care service after an Urgent and Emergency Care activity has concluded.
Notes:
• For patients who die in an Urgent and Emergency Care service this is the date, time and time zone that the body was removed from the Urgent and Emergency Care service.
• The patient may leave the Urgent and Emergency Care service temporarily during an Urgent and Emergency Care attendance, for example for an X-ray, but they remain under the care of an Urgent and Emergency Care Consultant.

A timestamp is represented with the components of date, time and either the number of hours offset (plus or minus) from Greenwich Mean Time, or the letter Z to signify that it is the same as Greenwich Mean Time.
 
Offset time is restricted to:
• +01:00
• +00:00
• -00:00
 
Examples of valid formats are:
• 2020-08-21T10:15:20+01:00 (British Summer Time (GMT + 1 Hour))
• 2020-08-21T10:15:20+00:00 (Greenwich Mean Time)
• 2020-08-21T10:15:20-00:00 (Greenwich Mean Time)
• 2020-08-21T09:18:00Z (Greenwich Mean Time)
 
To avoid confusion, if the timestamp occurs at midnight the time recorded should never be 00:00, it should always be either 23:59 or 00:01.
