The intended pattern of bed use for a patient, decided when the decision is made to admit, and only applies to patients on the Elective Admission List. This categorization describes what is intended to happen to the patient. Occasionally the patient’s treatment does not go exactly to plan. For example, a patient admitted as a day case may develop complications and have to be kept in overnight. Therefore another data item, patient classification, is used to describe what actually happens to the patient.
For RTT PTL data set: This is only applicable where the stage of pathway = 4. In cases where the pathway is in stages 1, 2, or 3, the field should remain blank.
