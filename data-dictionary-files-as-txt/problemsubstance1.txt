The main problem substance that has led the client to present (or be referred) to the substance misuse agency.
 
The specific substance causing the problem should still be recorded even if an individual advises that they are currently substance free.
 
Note: If a client has been prescribed substitute opioid medication (i.e. Methadone or Buprenorphine) these should not be listed as the main problem substance and instead Opiates should be recorded.
