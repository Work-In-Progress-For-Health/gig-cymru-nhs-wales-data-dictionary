Note: there is no record id in the layout of the Elective Admission List (EAL) mandatory dataset as this is a periodic census, providing a 'snapshot' on a specific date.
The values of the Record Id in the Admitted Patient Care (APC) layout were originally used for the Hospital Activity Analysis reporting. With the commencement of PEDW (early 1990's) these same values were carried forward into the APC development. At the time of the Outpatient mandated dataset it was agreed that these values should adopt a more logical standard.
 
* Bulk Delete Headers were introduced to enable organisations to delete a time series of data in one transaction instead of individual delete records.
 
Depending on the data provided as part of the bulk delete header record, individual deletion (‘D’) records are automatically created by the NHS Wales Data Switching Service, deleting the related records from the national databases.
 
A detailed description of the format and processing of bulk delete header records can be found on the NHS Wales Data Switching Service website, along with additional technical information relation to the submission of the data set:
