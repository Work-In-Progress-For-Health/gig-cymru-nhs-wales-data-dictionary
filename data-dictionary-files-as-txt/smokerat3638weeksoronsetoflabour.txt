The smoking status of the woman at 36-38 weeks, or onset of labour – i.e. is the woman a smoker?
 
Wherever possible, this should be validated via Carbon Monoxide testing (i.e. CO-validated).  Where not CO-validated, this should be the self-reported smoking status of the mother. The aim is that the information relates to a point as late in the pregnancy as is practically possible.
