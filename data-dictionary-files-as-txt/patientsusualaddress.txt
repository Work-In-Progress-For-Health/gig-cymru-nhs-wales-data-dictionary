This is the usual address:
•     (in the SCPC ds) for the patient at the Pathway Start Date (Point of Suspicion of Cancer)
•     (in every other data set listed above) nominated by the patient at the time of admission or attendance. If patients usually reside elsewhere are staying in hotels, hostels or other residential establishments for a short term, say a week, they should be recorded as staying at their usual place of residence. However if long term, such as at boarding school, the school address must be recorded. University students may nominate either their home address or the address of their university accommodation. Where patients are not capable of supplying this information, because of age or mental illness, for example, then the person responsible for the patient, such as a parent or guardian, should nominate the usual address. Patients not able to provide an address should be asked for their most recent address. If this cannot be established then you should record the address as `No fixed abode' or `Address unknown'. These patients are regarded as resident in the local geographical district for contracting purposes. For birth episodes this should refer to the mother's usual place of residence.
•     For RTT PTL data set: This relates to the patient’s current address at the time of reporting.
Format: 175 character alpha-numeric. This is based on 5 lines of 35 characters. This relates to the physical layout of the address, not the logical layout and does not require intelligent intervention when splitting the text string into lines.
Prior to April 1999 the PEDW Format: 100 character alpha-numeric. This is based on 4 lines of 25 characters. This relates to the physical layout of the address, not the logical layout.
