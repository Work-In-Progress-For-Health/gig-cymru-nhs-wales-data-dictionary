This is a classification of a patient's legal status which is either informal or as designated in the Mental Health Act 1983 or other acts. The classification "informal" is used for those patients who are not formally detained or not receiving supervised aftercare. The classification is required for all patients who have a hospital provider spell which includes the care of a Consultant in the psychiatric specialties or have been discharged from such a hospital provider spell and are required to receive supervised aftercare under the provision of the Mental Health (Patients in the Community) Act 1995.
For the APC ds99 this data item became effective from April 1999 and, with the data item Administrative Category, replaced the data item Category of Patient.
