The code assigned by Royal Mail to identify postal delivery areas across the United Kingdom.
This is the usual address
• (in the SCPC ds) for the patient at the Pathway Start Date (Point of Suspicion of Cancer)
• (in every other data set listed above) nominated by the patient at the time of admission or attendance
• For RTT PTL data set: This relates to the patient’s current postcode at the time of reporting.
Format: 8 character alpha-numeric. This allows a space to be inserted to differentiate between the inward and outward segments of the code, enabling full use to be made of the Royal Mail postcode functionality.
Organisation Data Service rules apply.
If a patient has no fixed abode, this should be recorded with the appropriate code (ZZ99 3VZ).
For overseas visitors, the postcode field must show the relevant country pseudo postcode commencing ZZ99, plus spaces followed by a numeric, then an alpha character, then a Z. For example, ZZ99 6CZ is the pseudo-postcode for India. Pseudo-postcodes can be found in the NHS Postcode Directory.
See Postcode
(PEDW (Prior to April 1999), Psychiatric Census)
