Along an entire patient pathway, ‘Stage of Pathway’ is used to identify the point at which a patient is currently waiting in respect of their overall diagnosis and treatment.
 
Whilst in the majority of patient pathways patients move from one stage to the next in sequence, there is no expectation that this must always be the case. Changes in clinical practice may introduce more variation over time. Therefore, these stages are not intended to be seen in chronological order only, as patients may commence their pathway at any one of the stages listed below.
