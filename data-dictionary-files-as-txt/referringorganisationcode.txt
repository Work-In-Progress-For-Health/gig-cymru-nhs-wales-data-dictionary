For Referral to Treatment Times (Combined):-
 
For the RTT (Combined) return, this data item should only be used to capture the 3 character Organisation Code (Code of Provider) when a tertiary referral takes place from one secondary care organisation to another for Cardiac patients only – i.e. Treatment Function Code 170 (Cardiothoracic Surgery) or 320 (Cardiology). In all other cases, ‘X98’ should be submitted.
 
The ‘receiving’ organisation is responsible for submitting RTT (Combined) data for any Cardiac tertiary referrals they have received from another organisation.
