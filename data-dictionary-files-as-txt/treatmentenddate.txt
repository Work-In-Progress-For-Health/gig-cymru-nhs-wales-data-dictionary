Emergency Department Attendance Treatment End Date is the date the Emergency Department clinical staff has finished treating the patient in their department.
This is the date that the patient is clinically defined as:
a.  ready to be discharged
b.  ready to be transferred via ambulance to continue treatment elsewhere
c.  ready for admission onto a ward
d.  OR, the date that the patient self-discharges or dies.
 
Note: For patients being discharged from the Emergency Department because they are clinically fit to leave, the Treatment End Date and the Departure Date will be the same. Where a Treatment End Time is present in the daily and monthly EDDS submissions, it will be assumed that a clinical exception applies and the 4 and 8 hour measure will be based on this time. Where a Treatment End Time is not present, it will be assumed that a clinical exception does not apply and the 4 and 8 hour measure will be calculated using Departure Time.
