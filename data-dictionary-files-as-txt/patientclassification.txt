A coded classification of Patients who have been admitted to a Hospital Provider Spell, derived by combining data items on the patient administration systems, namely Admission Method, Intended Management and ward use with actual duration of stay in a hospital bed. The duration of stay is derived by subtracting the date of admission from the date of discharge.
In the case of maternity patients, the use being made of the delivery facilities is also used in the derivation.

The flowchart shows the derivation of Patient Classification from method of admission, intended management; ward used and actual duration of stay in a hospital bed. The one exception is for any episode in a day case spell that is not the final episode. For these episodes, which should be rare, the patient classification will be 'ordinary admission' rather than 'day case admission'. The last episode in this spell will have the correct value of 'day case' admission.
