This is a classification used to identify the source of referral where the recording guidelines (See Definitions document for pathway start date definitions http://www.walescanet.wales.nhs.uk/scp-key-documents) advise that the point of suspicion for recording is different to that of the first clinical suspicion of cancer e.g. Receiving clinician suspects cancer in a referral (on vetting) not originally referred as ‘suspected cancer’ - the date and source proposed by the guidelines would be for the original referral from primary care. Source of Referral is how the patient entered the pathway, and Source of Suspicion is what triggered the suspicion of cancer. Subsequently the Source of Suspicion and Source of Referral (Cancer Wait Times) can differ but in most cases will be the same.
