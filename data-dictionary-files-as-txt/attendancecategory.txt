FOR EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT DATA SET:
Accident and Emergency Attendance Category is an indication of whether a patient is making a first or follow-up attendance at the Accident and Emergency Department.
New Attendance
A new attendance is the first visit made by a patient to the Accident and Emergency Department for a particular injury or ailment. A new attendance can be the first in a series or one single attendance in an Accident and Emergency Department.
Planned Follow-up Attendance
A follow-up Accident and Emergency Attendance is a subsequent planned attendance at the same department, and for the same incident as the first attendance. A planned follow-up attendance is agreed or requested by a clinician.
Unplanned Follow-up Attendance
A patient returning to the Accident and Emergency Department with a conditional previously treated where they have not been asked to return by the clinician will be counted as an unplanned follow-up attendance.
Please note: This definition of an Attendance Category applies to QS1 and EDDS Reporting. For SITREPS Reporting, Unplanned Follow-ups should be counted as 'New Attendances'.
