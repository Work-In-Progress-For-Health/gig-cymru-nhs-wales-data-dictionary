The NHS number is the primary identifier of a person, and is a unique identifier for a patient within the NHS in Wales.
It is mandatory to record the NHS Number
•    (in the MI ds) for each woman and baby
•    (in every other data set) for each patient registered with a GP practice in England and Wales.
The NHS number is allocated to an individual, to enable unique identification for NHS health care purposes.
The MI ds captures data relating to the woman at initial assessment and to mother and baby for all births.  Each Health Board makes data available in relation to the events which they managed, and initial assessment and birth data will be linked nationally regardless of whether both events took place in the same or at different health boards.  The NHS number is needed on each record to enable this data to be linked.
This NHS Number format was mandated for use effective 1st November 1997. Prior to this, the NHS Number was an alphanumeric code which ranged in size from 10 – 17 characters.
If known, the patient’s Health and Care Number should be used to populate this field for patients resident in Northern Ireland.
If known, the patient’s Community Health Index (CHI) Number should be used to populate this field for patients resident in Scotland.
 
Format: 10 digit numeric

Check Digit Algorithm
(This algorithm applies to the Welsh and English NHS Number and the Northern Ireland Health & Care Number. The check digit algorithm for the Scottish CHI Number is available on request from the NHS Wales Informatics Service.)
Step 1 Multiply each of the first nine digits by a weighting factor as follows:
Digit Position (starting from the left)
Factor
1
10
2
9
3
8
4
7
5
6
6
5
7
4
8
3
9
2
Step 2 Add the results of each multiplication together
Step 3 Divide the total by 11 and establish the remainder
Step 4 Subtract the remainder from 11 to give the check digit
Step 5 Check the remainder matches the check digit. If it does not, the number is invalid.
If the result of Step 4 is 11 then a check digit of 0 is used
If the result of Step 4 is 10 then the number is invalid and not used
