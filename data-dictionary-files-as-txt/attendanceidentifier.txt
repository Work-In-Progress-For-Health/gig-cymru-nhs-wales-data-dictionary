A sequential number or time of day used to enable an attendance or appointment to be uniquely identified.
Note: If a patient is seen by a doctor, sent elsewhere for a test or X ray and then seen again by a doctor of the same Consultants firm during the same clinic session, it would be recorded as one attendance - not two.
