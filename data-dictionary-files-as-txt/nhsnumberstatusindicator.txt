The status indicator provides information about the potential accuracy and reliability of the NHS number and hence the use to which the number can be put. The indicator can also be used to indicate the general standard of patient data quality within Trusts. This data item became mandatory in Wales in April 1999.

nn
Number present and traced using Welsh Patient Demographic Service
Welsh LHB's should look for high levels of NHS numbers which have an associated status indicator value of 'nn'.

01
Number present & traced
Providers should be striving to submit numbers that have been traced against an authoritative source (currently the Initial Tracing Service) and so are as reliable and accurate as possible. Therefore Local Health Boards should look for high levels of NHS numbers which have an associated status indicator value of "01".
1st April 1999
 
02
Number present but not traced
This value reveals that although a number is present, it has not been traced against an authoritative source i.e. it has most likely been manually input but not sent to the Initial Tracing Service for checking. An exception to this could be that the NHS number has entered the provider system electronically from a reliable and safe source other than the authoritative tracing service. Users of NHS numbers with a status indicator value of "02" should be cautious.
1st April 1999
 
03
Trace required
The provider should submit patient details for NHS number tracing before DS's are submitted. Therefore the proportion of missing numbers is indicated by the "03" value should be very small.
1st April 1999
 
04
Trace attempted – no match or multiple match found
A significant proportion of "04s" could indicate data quality problems at the provider. However, the LHB should take account of whether the provider has a high level of difficulty to trace patient’s e.g. ethnic names, mobile population.
1st April 1999
 
05
Trace needs to be resolved (NHS number or patient detail conflict)
High levels of "05s" imply that the NHS numbers sent by the provider for check tracking are incorrect for the patient. This indicates poor quality of data which could either be due to a poor original source e.g. wrong number given on a GP referral letter, or poor data input by the provider.
1st April 1999
 
06
Trace in progress
This value indicates that the NHS number has been submitted for tracing but a response is awaited. Local Health Boards should expect to see a small proportion of these as the time of DS submission may be before the response from the tracing service is received.
1st April 1999
 
07
Number not present and trace not required
Two circumstances are explained by this indicator:
1st April 1999
 
 
1.
NHS number is not required e.g. overseas visitor. This should be easy to identify from other DS data items
 
 
 
2.
There is insufficient patient data to enable a successful trace to be made. Local Health Boards need to be more cautious about this reason although they should take into account the type of population the provider serves e.g. itinerants and mental health patients who may not be willing or able to provide sufficient information.
 
 
 
 
Note: Local Health Boards should expect to see a small proportion of cases where there is no NHS number at all.
 
 
08
Trace postponed (baby under six weeks old)
This indicator should only be used for babies under six weeks old and Local Health Boards should check the date of birth details on the DS.
