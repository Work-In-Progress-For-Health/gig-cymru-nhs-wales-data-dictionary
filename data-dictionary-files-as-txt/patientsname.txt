This will be the patients preferred name.  The patient is the arbiter of his/her/their name.
Format: either structured with two 35 alpha character elements (forename followed by surname) or an unstructured string of 70 characters. Use block capitals, ignore apostrophes and insert space for hyphen. Enter surname first then as many letters of the first name as possible, leaving a blank box between each part of the name. Double-barrelled surnames should be coded in the same order as in the hospital records. Name Format Code indicates which format is being used.
