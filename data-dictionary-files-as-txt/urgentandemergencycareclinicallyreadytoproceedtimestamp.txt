This is the first date, time and time zone that the Care Professional, authorised to discharge the patient from an Urgent and Emergency Care service, makes a clinical decision that the patient no longer requires ongoing care in the Urgent and Emergency Care service.
The Patient will have one of the following outcomes:
• Admitted to a ward
• Transferred to a designated department/clinical service area outside the Urgent and Emergency Care service but within the same Health Care Provider
• Transferred to another Health Care Provider for continuation of care
• Discharged from the Urgent and Emergency Care service
 
Format: maximum 25 character alphanumeric
 
A timestamp is represented with the components of date, time and either the number of hours offset (plus or minus) from Greenwich Mean Time, or the letter Z to signify that it is the same as Greenwich Mean Time.
Offset time is restricted to:
• +01:00
• +00:00
• -00:00
Examples of valid formats are:
• 2020-08-21T10:15:20+01:00 (British Summer Time (GMT + 1 Hour))
• 2020-08-21T10:15:20+00:00 (Greenwich Mean Time)
• 2020-08-21T10:15:20-00:00 (Greenwich Mean Time)
• 2020-08-21T09:18:00Z (Greenwich Mean Time)
To avoid confusion, if the timestamp occurs at midnight the time recorded should never be 00:00, it should always be either 23:59 or 00:01.
