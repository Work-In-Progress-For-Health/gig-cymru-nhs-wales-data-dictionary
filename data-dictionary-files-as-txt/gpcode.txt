Meaning
GNNNNNNN
A code issued by the Department of Health (DH) for practising GP's in Wales and England.  The codes can be viewed on the Health Reference Data Web Pages on HOWIS.
 
Structure
Each GP code begins with the letter G.
The 2nd to 7th characters are the DH Index Number. Index Numbers and addresses are issued quarterly by the Prescription Pricing Authority (PPA). The eighth character is a check digit calculated thus:
First numeric character
+ 3     x     second character
+ 7     x     third character
+ 1     x     fourth character
+ 3     x     fifth character
+ 7     x     sixth character
The check digit is then the unit digit (last digit) of the result of this calculation.
e.g.     PPA code 334512. Check digit is computed by:
3 + (3 x 3) + (7 x 4) + 5 + (3 x 1) + (7 x 2) = 62
The check digit is 2 and the full code G3345122.
