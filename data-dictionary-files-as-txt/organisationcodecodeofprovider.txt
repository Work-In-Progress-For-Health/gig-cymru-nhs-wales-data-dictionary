This is the organisation code of the health care provider. The provider code identifies the health care provider who is responsible for managing the treatment of the patient.
 
Notes:
1.  Healthcare providers may also act as commissioners when sub-contracting patient care services to other providers of health care.
2.  Although the healthcare provider identified in this data item is responsible for managing the patient’s treatment, it may not necessarily be where the treatment is actually conducted. For example, where the treatment has been sub-contracted to another healthcare provider.
3.  For OPR ds, the Organisation Code (Code of Provider) is that of the organisation receiving the referral. If the provider is a Local Health Board/Trust, use the 3 character Local Health Board/Trust code with 2 zeros placed in the 4th and 5th character position.
4.  For Referral to Treatment Times (Combined), use the 3 character Local Health Board/Trust code.
 
Format:
For Patient Level Data Sets (APC, OP, CC, OPR, PAP, RTDS):-
5 character alpha-numeric Local Health Board/Trust Code with 2 zeros placed in the 4th and 5th character position.
For Aggregate Data Collections (DATS and RTT (Combined):-
3 character alpha numeric Local Health Board/Trust Code
