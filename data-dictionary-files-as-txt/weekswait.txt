The time bands for reporting the waiting time counts, some values of which vary between returns developed for different purposes.
The principle for recording the time band for a week’s wait is shown below: -
For reporting purposes a week’s wait is a value of x and refers to "Over x weeks and up to x+1 weeks".
The calculation from days to weeks wait reported is Integer value of (days-1)/7 or zero, whichever is greater.
For example, to calculate the weeks wait for 277 days; use the calculation (days-1)/7: -
(277-1)/7 = 39.428 (equivalent to 39 weeks and 4 days). This will be recorded under the 'Over 39 weeks and up to 40 weeks (Day 274 – 280)' Time Band.
The definition for 999 is different within the RTT (Combined) collections. In RTT (Combined) it refers to patients with unknown RTT start clock date.  The correct definition must be applied to the relevant return.
Diagnostic and Therapy Waiting Times: -
The count of waiting time will start from the date the referral was received to the service undertaking the diagnostic test or therapy intervention, which may be the same as the date the referral is received into the organisation (during a direct to test scenario), but is not necessarily the same date, and end on the census date, which is the last day of each month.
The waiting times will be reported grouped within time bands described in weeks up to 40 weeks wait. All waits beyond that will be reported in one group.

Up to 1 week (up to and including 7 days)

Over 1 week and up to 2 weeks (day 8 to 14)

40

Referral to Treatment Times (Combined): -
For open pathways, the length of referral to treatment time will be from the clock start date to the end of the census date, which is the last day of the month.
For closed pathways, the length of referral to treatment time will be from the clock start date to the clock stop date, which is within the reporting period.
The referral to treatment times will be reported grouped in time bands described in weeks up to 40 weeks. Over that, reporting will be in 4-week time bands up to a specified 105 weeks wait. Waits beyond that will be reported in one group. Where a Local Health Board/Trust is unable to identify a start clock dates for patients, these will be reported using a Weeks Wait value of '999'.

For open pathways, the length of the pathway is measured from the date of referral to the date of the return date (end of the month). An open pathway is recorded where a patient falls within the scope of the target who has not yet reached a stop clock point at the end of the month.
For closed pathways, the length of the pathway is measured from the date of referral to the date of the stop clock point. A closed pathway is recorded where a patient who falls within the scope of the target has reached a stop clock point within the month.
 
Angiogram (Retired): -
The count of waiting time is the difference in weeks between the return date and the date of decision to admit, not counting periods of suspension. Refer to the current rules regarding management of suspensions.
The waiting times will be reported grouped within time bands described in weeks up to 26 weeks wait. All waits beyond that will be reported in one group.
